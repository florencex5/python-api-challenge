# Python-API-Challenge

## Main Purposes
- Creating a model of weather from 1500 samples which determined by random selected
longitude and latitude (Total number of sampled cities: 549 )
- Using linear regression model to check if latitude will affect the weather conditions
(E.g. Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed)
- Using Pandas to filter the sampled cities by setting up:
    1) Cloudiness equals to 0 %
    2) Max Temperature is between 18 C and 22 C
    3) Wind speed is smaller than or equal to 4 m/s
- Using Geoapify API to search the hotels which met the specific conditions

## Sources
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Geoapify API
